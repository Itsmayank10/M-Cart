# M-Cart(Django Application)
M-Cart is a E-Comm. website through which you can easily shop fashion products
M-Cart sales the fashion products at very low price.
You just have to ad the product and place your Order.
You can also track your orders through it.
At the Front End I use:-HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, AND JQuery, AJAX.
At the Back end I use:-Python Programming Lang and SQLite Database.
This whole web application is made with use of Python Django Framework.
